# FREEWAY TERROR (2019, by Josh Ramos)


## Background
This arcade game I made for a high school assignment 4 years ago :D. In this game, you
play as an absolute madman who decides to drive on the wrong size of the road. Use your
arrow keys to avoid traffic and try to survive for as long as possible.

### Q: Why on earth am I uploading a project from 4 years ago?
A: I recently recovered these from an old laptop and decided it would be cool to 
archive it.

### Q: Why are all the assets in the root folder?
A: It is clear that 16 year old Josh didn't have the foresight to organise his assets
properly. Anyways, it's nice to see how much by code style and organisation has improved over the last
4 years!
