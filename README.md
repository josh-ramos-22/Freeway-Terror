# FREEWAY TERROR (2019, by Josh Ramos)


## Background
This arcade game I made for a high school assignment 4 years ago :D. In this game, you
play as an absolute madman who decides to drive on the wrong size of the road. Use your
arrow keys to avoid traffic and try to survive for as long as possible.

### Q: Why on earth am I uploading a project from 4 years ago?
A: I recently updated my WSL to allow it to support Linux GUI applications in order 
to work on my AI assignment. Remembering that I had saved the old files from my old
SDD project, I decided to try running it for the first time in years. To my surprise, after installing pygame, it ran completely as expected! Excited, I decided to upload
it to my repo, just to make sure it's preserved forever :)

### Q: Why are all the assets in the root folder?
A: It is clear that 16 year old Josh didn't have the foresight to organise his assets
properly. I'll reorganise everything when I have free time :)
